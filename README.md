# WebHdf

A library to load HDF files in the webbrowser. The code is based on PasHdf and thus written in Object Pascal. It can easily get cross compiled to JavaScript using the [Hope](https://github.com/Walibeiro/Hope) command line compiler.

## HDF completeness
At the moment the library can only read a subset of features available in HDF. However, with some help this could get expanded fully read and write all types of HDF files.

## Disclaimer
The code is based on the original [HDF specifications](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/doc/H5.format.html) and the source code of [libmysofa](https://github.com/hoene/libmysofa).
